we are failing to clear the "parent_tag" and that is inserting stuff
we also need to ensure that we are decrementing the depth, as that is now used as an index to navigate the html_vec of tags

Maybe we should be using https://github.com/shepmaster/sxd-xpath or just hack https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq to match our syntax

`htmlq -f test.html img -a src` is very similar to our needs
`htmlq -f test.html a -a href` has the functionality, but with additional flags, that we want to be able to infer from the limited HTML tags and attributes.
